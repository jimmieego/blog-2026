The way I've seen great work made is...

\- Starting from solution first

\- Caring ruthlessly about the details. Craft and quality take concerted time.

\- Operating on intuition. Intuition is not guessing. Intuition is the ability to make reasoned judgments, quickly. Build intuition from:

&#x9;\- Reading product feedback.

&#x9;\- User research.

&#x9;\- Dashboard/Metrics.

\- Skipping steps and making them up. Your value as a designer is honing the process.

\- Doing something just for the sake of making people smile

It's time to trust ourselves again.
